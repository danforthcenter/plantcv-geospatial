## Documentation

PlantCV documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). 
Using Read the Docs allows the documentation to be versioned along with
the code. Because Read the Docs supports static content build tools like
[Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), documentation can be written in simple
Markdown format that will be built into HTML automatically whenever a 
new version of code is pushed to the PlantCV GitHub repository.

### Updating PlantCV documentation

Follow the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how clone a copy of the PlantCV-Annotate
repository, edit files, and generate a `pull` request to merge your updates back into the 
main repository. Changes to PlantCV should be done in a branch, and pull against the 
`main` branch  which corresponds to the `latest` version of the documentation on Read the Docs.

PlantCV-Geopspatial is an add-on package to compliment functionality of
[PlantCV](https://plantcv.org) so please refer to the 
[updating guide here](https://plantcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/).
